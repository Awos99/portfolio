**Introduction**

This API provides authentication and access to character data, allowing users to perform various operations related to characters. Users can log in, retrieve character information, add new characters, update character data, and delete characters.

**Authentication**

Authentication is required to access certain endpoints of the API. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. To authenticate, users must obtain an access token by providing a valid email and password through the **/login** endpoint. The access token is then included in the headers of subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The token is valid for 1 hour.

Main URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000

**Endpoints**
1. **Login**

  Send a GET request to login to the API and receive an access token that will be necessary for future requests.

![Demo GIF](/static/demo.gif)

## Overview
This repository contains a Streamlit application that provides a graphical interface for building and customizing Scikit-Learn pipelines. Designed as a learning tool, it bridges the gap between complex coding requirements and fully automated systems, offering a hands-on approach to understanding machine learning workflows.

## How It Works
The application allows users to construct a machine learning pipeline using a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface:

1. **Data Upload**: Users start by uploading a CSV file.
2. **Column Selection**: Users specify which columns to use as predictors and which as the target.
3. **Pipeline Construction**:
   - A graphical interface displays the available steps of a machine learning pipeline.
   - Users drag and drop different pipeline blocks into place to construct their workflow.
4. **Execution and Customization**:
   - Clicking 'Execute' initializes the customization phase where users can configure the settings of individual blocks, especially the Column Transformers.
5. **Model Training**:
   - After customization, users can 'Fit' their model to the data, evaluate its performance, and see the test error.
6. **Model Export**:
   - The trained model can be downloaded as a `.joblib` file.

## Development Notes
- **Error Handling**: Minimal error handling is currently implemented.
- **Unique Naming**: Each pipeline block must have a unique name to avoid conflicts.

## Challenges
- **Code Generation**: Converting the visual pipeline representation into executable code was challenging and required developing a complex recursive algorithm.
- **UI Personalization**: Enhancing the customization options for blocks to improve user interface flexibility remains a challenge.

## Potential with LLMs
While currently not implemented, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) could further enhance this application by guiding users in the development of the pipeline.

![Demo GIF](/static/demo.gif)

## Overview
This repository contains a Streamlit application that simplifies data visualization and manipulation using natural language. Users can upload CSV or Excel files, visualize and interact with the data, and modify it using commands in natural language, powered by a custom agent using ChatGPT-4o.

## How It Works
The application workflow is designed for ease of use and interactive data manipulation:

1. **File Upload**: Users can upload a CSV or Excel file which is then read into a DataFrame.
2. **Data Visualization**: The uploaded data is displayed, allowing users to visually inspect and interact with their dataset.
3. **Row Deletion**: Users can delete rows directly from the visualization interface. Note: Due to a current Streamlit widget bug, rows must be deleted twice.
4. **Column Removal**: Users have the option to drop columns from the DataFrame as needed.
5. **Natural Language Queries**: Users can specify queries or commands in natural language to modify the data.
6. **Query Processing and Execution**:
   - Queries are processed by a custom agent equipped with ChatGPT-4o, using the first 5 rows of the DataFrame to generate Python code within a `modify_df` function.
   - This code is executed to apply the specified modifications and return an updated DataFrame.

## Enhanced Capabilities with LLMs
Integrating advanced LLMs like ChatGPT-4o into this application unlocks significant potential for natural language processing in data manipulation. This allows users to interact with data in a more intuitive and accessible manner, reducing the need for technical expertise in data analysis or programming.

## Challenges and Development
The main challenge in this project has been creating robust prompts that consistently return executable Python code. Currently, as this is a prototype designed to showcase the capabilities of LLMs in streamlining data operations, error handling has not yet been implemented. This presents an ongoing area for development to enhance the application's reliability and user experience.

![Demo GIF](/static/demo.gif)

## Overview
This repository hosts the prototype of an innovative tool designed to leverage the capabilities of an *SQL Agent* from LangChain to facilitate querying databases using natural language. This project harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs) to interpret and translate user queries into executable SQL commands.

## How It Works
The application workflow is intuitive and efficient, making it accessible for users without deep technical expertise in SQL:

1. **User Input**: The user poses a question to the application.
2. **Description Generation**: A descriptive message about the database is generated by providing an LLM (specifically ChatGPT-3.5) with the first three rows from all tables within the database.
3. **Query Generation and Execution**:
   - The SQL Agent crafts an SQL query based on the input.
   - This query is retrieved via a callback handler and executed against the database to fetch the necessary information.
4. **Response Generation**: The application uses the retrieved data and the original user question to generate a comprehensive answer.
5. **Query Modification**: Users have the flexibility to modify the auto-generated SQL query and rerun it, allowing for customization and refinement of results.
6. **Data Visualization and Export**: The retrieved data can be visualized through bar, line, or scatter plots, or downloaded as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Enhanced Capabilities with LLMs
Integrating LLMs like ChatGPT-3.5 significantly enhances the application's functionality. These models bring a deep understanding of natural language, enabling the system to handle a wide range of queries and generate precise SQL commands. This integration points to a future where natural language can serve as a powerful interface for complex database interactions, making data more accessible to non-specialist users.

## Challenges Encountered
The development of this application presented several unique challenges:
- **SQL Query Retrieval**: Extracting the dynamically generated SQL query from the SQL Agent was particularly challenging, given that the agent's definitions are managed externally by the LangChain library.
- **Widget Management**: The sequential loading behavior of widgets in Streamlit necessitated careful planning of the user interface layout to ensure a logical and user-friendly order of operations.
